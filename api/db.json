app.get('/api/notes', (req, res) => {
    res.send('Hello World!'))
  }); 

GET /notes should return the notes.html file.

GET * should return the index.html file.

The following API routes should be created:

GET /api/notes should read the db.json file and return all saved notes as JSON.

POST /api/notes should receive a new note to save on the request body,
 add it to the db.json file, and then return the new note to the client. 
 You'll need 
to find a way to give each note a unique id when it's
 saved (look into npm packages that could do this for you).

 DELETE /api/notes/:id should receive a query
  parameter that contains the id of a note to delete.
   To delete a note, you'll need to read all notes from the db.json file, 
   remove the note with the given id property,
  and then rewrite the notes to the db.json file.
